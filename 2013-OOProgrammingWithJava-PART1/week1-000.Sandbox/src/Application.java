/*NetBeans is able to show a class API, if needed. If you write a class name
and add the relative import sentence, you can right click on the class name

/*NetBeans allows for the automatic creation of the equals and hashCode methods.
From the menu Source -> Insert Code, you can choose equals() and hashCode(). 
After this, NetBeans asks which object variables the methods shall use.
